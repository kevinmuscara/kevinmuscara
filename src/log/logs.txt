[09:12:12] SERVER (Devcord) (offtopic) (Elvanos): <@!342948106985537539> only people using VIM get carpal tunnel because they never take their hands off the keyboard <:troll_devcord:377394372834230273>
[09:12:15] SERVER (Devcord) (help-backend) (pvtHenk): so like I said, traditionally that'd be a user id, perhaps some basic info like email, first name, last name, whatever. And then a list of permissions/roles

[09:13:38] SERVER (Devcord) (offtopic) (lost): i guess i might also need a bigger mouse mat lmao
[09:13:42] SERVER (Devcord) (help-backend) (pvtHenk): they deal with all the login stuff, and I deal with all of the application stuff :)
