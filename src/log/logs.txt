[17:09:34] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (S3BAS): Actually, I think you're misunderstanding how the lifecycle of react works perhaps?
[17:09:40] SERVER (Devcord) (offtopic) (ewiggle): Vim people seem to like it a lot so it kind of came with the territory and I just ended up learning a bit of that as well
[17:09:47] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (malik): <@!92644666956070912> On what you've said, you know I have to like empty the list before another request else imma get duplicate value
[17:09:54] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (S3BAS): Each time you call `setState` the component will go through some cycle, of which 1 of these is calling `componentDidUpdate`
[17:10:00] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): ok here is what you do
[17:10:05] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): you explain your question nicely
[17:10:17] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): and then you show us what you have right now
[17:10:19] SERVER (Devcord) (offtopic) (ewiggle): Coolest thing about tnux is saving a session and basically letting several people edit and see the same terminal at the same time, like a screen share
[17:10:40] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (malik): Okay, I will just try the Stringify method rn
[17:10:43] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (MWR): at this point your question is so fragmented it's impossible lmfao
[17:10:43] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): your question should also tell what your goal is
[17:10:55] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (S3BAS): > On what you've said, you know I have to like empty the list before another request else imma get duplicate value
You can just overwrite the state, which is what you're supposed to do anyways, but that's a seperate issue besides the infinite looping
[17:11:54] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): ```

[17:12:14] SERVER (Devcord) (offtopic) (ewiggle): Aside from that, vim has comparable screen splitting
[17:12:26] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (MWR): tora big gay with his upvote reactions
[17:12:29] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (S3BAS): Idk what you're on about, the issue at hand is the infinite looping which is caused by `setState` in `componentDidUpdate` no?
[17:12:33] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (S3BAS): What's not clear about that
[17:13:02] SERVER (Devcord) (offtopic) (ewiggle): Haven't messed with many tmux plugins yet though
[17:13:14] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): i get that, but why is he doing it this way, what does he want to do, why does not want to use tora's thing for comparing array etc etc
[17:13:27] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (S3BAS): He just said he'll use Stringify
[17:13:32] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (ToRA): there's too much info behind closed doors
[17:13:36] SERVER (Devcord) (webtopic) (Saghen): yo with the bash language support you can gold things
[17:13:36] SERVER (Devcord) (offtopic) (chimp): how'd u initially get into vim, `vimtutor`?
[17:13:43] SERVER (Devcord) (webtopic) (Saghen): ```bash
$jajajaja
```
[17:13:47] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): > On what you've said, you know I have to like empty the list before another request else imma get duplicate value
[17:13:49] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (ToRA): we should try to make sure this isnt an XY problem
[17:13:52] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (neo): he also said this just after that
[17:13:59] SERVER (Devcord) (help-javascript) (malik): 1. I am trying to fetch the latest updates from the API
2. I have tried comparing the current state of the users with prevState (even using Stringify as Tora suggested)
4. I think componentDidUpdate() is the best way to do it
